# CluVis - Cluster Visualizer

CluVis is an appliaction written as part of my eng. thesis. It was primarily meant to cluster and visualize, using at least two different visualization algorithms, RSES generated rule-sets. During the 
course of time it's functionalities were extended to the point it started to allow interferencing on generated rule clusters.

The application is going to be rewritten in the future, as it became a huge (but functional!) mess.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

For development I'm using:
* C++11 compatible MinGW,
* QT v. 5.10.

### Installing

In my case it all went down to installing Qt Creator with MinGW. 

### And coding style tests

To be filled after major refactor.

## Deployment

To be added...

## Built With

I'm using Qt Creator for building. 

## Versioning
